# pxbee-fwup.js

A command line utility `fwup.js` for interacting with [Digi](https://www.digi.com)'s XBee radios that are
equipped with an 8-bit microcontroller HCS08 for application logic. By default, the provided SDK is only operable
within Windows. So for Linux/MacOS alternative tooling is required.

*NB!* This is still a work-in-progress and no guarantees are given that this software works as intended.
Feel free to experiment but be careful and use this software only at your own risk!

## Demo

## `fwup` features:

- Init sequence for the module to boot into Bootloader menu
- Going into Bypass mode (in this case the module can be operated as any standard XBee radio)
- HCS08 Firmware upgrade via XMODEM transfer

Planned featured (TBD):

- Over-the-air firmware upgrade

Expect to work with Programmable S2B modules as well as the following [S2C Modules](https://www.digi.com/products/xbee-rf-solutions/2-4-ghz-modules/xbee-zigbee#partnumbers):
